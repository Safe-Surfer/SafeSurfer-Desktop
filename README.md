## Project development
[Development has moved to GitLab](https://gitlab.com/safesurfer/SafeSurfer-Desktop).

## Who is [Safe Surfer](http://safesurfer.co.nz)?
Safe Surfer's mission is to keep children, individuals, and organisations safe online. We achieve this by filtering out harmful material that may be found when browsing the internet and switching on safe search for a number of search engines.  
You can read more [here](http://www.safesurfer.co.nz/the-cause).  

## App information
Safe Surfer's desktop app sets Safe Surfer up on your computer for you.  
Our aim for this project is to make it as easy as possible to get families and persons protected online on their desktops or laptops, ensuring safety and peace-of-mind.  

For enterprise/business use, we recommend to apply the DNS settings on a router which devices are connected to, please refer to the [Safe Surfer website](http://safesurfer.co.nz).
